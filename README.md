## Reactive Form

## How to Run the App 

1. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
2. Open the folder called "UsersListServer" in your CMD and write the next command to open the JSON Web Server


``
json-server --watch db.json
``

Once the server is running, then you can test the App in your http://localhost:4200/ 

## Improvements that I would like to do

- Enable the existent async. validation for the mail field

- Create a Wrapper Component for all the form and write there all the error messages

- Better organisation with fields

- Create an Auth Password with JSON Web Token
